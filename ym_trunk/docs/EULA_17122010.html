The first being a plain and simple (but not legally binding) version with real world examples, the second being the actual legal agreement. We hope that reading the first section makes understanding the second one easier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c9 heading3"><span class="c6 c2">The license explained</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">You are agreeing to 2 licenses</span><span class="c1">. The first license is called GPL and covers the PHP code which is compiled at run time, this license is the same as the one WordPress uses. The Second license is Coding Futures EULA agreement for our assets usage and covers all other assets usage unless such asssets are held under a seaparate license, compatible with either the GPL or Coding Futures EULA. We have a special provision in the EULA agreement that allows assets protected by it to be converted to GPL should anything happen to the company.</span></p><p <p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">You do not own the assets; we merely grant you the right to use them</span><span class="c1">. This is a pretty standard thing for software licenses and covers the Coding Futures EULA agreement and whilst in theory we can revoke your license at any time for any reason, it&rsquo;s nothing something we&rsquo;re likely to ever do. This would not prevent you using the PHP files it would just be minus a pretty interface</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">We limit the license to a specific number of web sites.</span><span class="c1">The difference between purchases is normally one of support, so if you purchase a single license Coding Futures will only support one site. However the Coding Futures EULA also enforces this. However the GPL code can be used multiple times. If you bought a single license you can install and use the software and claim support on one web site only, if you bought a multi-site (Ultimate) license you can install it on multiple web sitesand we will support each site. The website may have multiple domain names or be served from multiple servers (real or virtualized), as long as it is serving up the same content on them. If the content differs by domain or server, it is classed as a different site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For single licenses, we do make an exception where if the software is first installed on a test site during development, but then used on a different site when the product is put live, on the understanding that the software is used in the test environment ONLY before it is used in the live environment and no transactions (other than obvious test transactions) are made on the test site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">You cannot resell the software to somebody else while it contains assets covered under the Coding Futures EULA, although you can include it as part of a website you provide directly to somebody else.</span><span class="c1"> If you&rsquo;re a web developer developing sites for other people, that&rsquo;s ok (obviously you can only include it with one web site if you&rsquo;ve purchased a single site license), but you can&rsquo;t sell (or give away) Your Members on its own, it must be part of a complete website. If you do provide the software as part of a website, you must include these licenses with it, and make the website owner aware they inherit the terms of these licenses and that the software is license for that single website only.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">You can modify the software</span><span class="c1">. We pride ourselves on being &ldquo;developer friendly&rdquo; and as such feel you should have complete access to our source code to modify to fit your needs. The PHP code is covered under the GPL which encourages modification. Other code assets unless specified remain our intellectual property, our commercial property and our livelihood, not yours to give away or use commercially, except as part of the website you develop. We also insist you leave any copyright notices intact where you find them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if you do modify the software, it&rsquo;s possible we may choose not to support you (especially if we&rsquo;re trying to support issue complicated by your changes) and we also assume you&rsquo;re done trialing the software (thus ending any trial period you may have).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">Any support we provide is entirely at our discretion</span><span class="c1">. We pride ourselves on our support, but we have our limits. We reserve the right to limit support if we feel it&rsquo;s being abused or if requests are unreasonable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">By purchasing Your Members, you allow us to collect, store and use information about you, your web server and your web site.</span><span class="c1"> We use your personal data to provide support and administration services as well as our own statistical analysis and marketing. However we won&rsquo;t pass your details onto any 3rd party (although we may store it on third party servers or use it in third party tools). We&rsquo;re not in the habit of spamming you with &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; but do like to stay in contact; therefore we&rsquo;d like to add you to our mailing list. However, we&rsquo;re aware some people won&rsquo;t want to receive any marketing at all, so we of course give you the option to opt-out of marketing at any time. &nbsp;Also during both the purchase and registration processes, we collect information about you (i.e. your name ane email address), and your website (such as the domain name) to use for both authorization and version control. Finally, we collect anonymous usage stats to help us improve the software.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">If one day we decided to sell Your Members to another company, we reserve the right to pass your details along as customers to them</span><span class="c1">. Whilst this seems to go against our &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t sell your details to third parties&rdquo; statement, we feel if one day we sell Your Members to another company, we think it&rsquo;s only fair we tell them who their new customers are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions</span><span class="c1">. It&rsquo;s another standard clause, but don&rsquo;t worry, if we change them, we&rsquo;ll tell you, and you&rsquo;ll have a right to reject them (giving up your license to use the software in the process), it just means if our lawyers get onto us and tell us we should be doing this differently, we can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">8. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">You may not use the software as part of any website which is deemed illegal in its relevant jurisdiction. </span><span class="c1">We don&rsquo;t want to decide what it right and what is wrong however but in the case assets covered under the Coding Futures EULA agreement, but if whatever jurisdiction your website falls under deemed your content to be illegal, we don&rsquo;t want you using Your Members to protect it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">9. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">You may not offer support, service or training services using our materials specifically for Your Members without our prior acknowledgement. </span><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re more than happy for you to support your customers and show them how to use Your Members, but we draw the line at you setting yourself up offering training and support services that rival our own using our own material!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">10. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You use the software at your own risk. </span><span class="c1">This is also a standard clause in software licenses. We do what we can to ensure the software doesn&rsquo;t cause you problems, but we can&rsquo;t be responsible for everything it can do under every circumstance. Therefore, if it goes wrong, we can&rsquo;t be held financially liable for damage it causes. Obviously we&rsquo;ll normally do what we can to help, but standard precautions such as having good tested back-ups and thoroughly beta testing your sites can alleviate most of the risk. This is the same in both licenses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">11. &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">Export Restrictions</span><span class="c1">. We have nothing against the countries listed, unfortunately there is a minefield of legal complications surrounding exporting from the United Kingdom to these countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">12. &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">Conditions of Purchase</span><span class="c1"> is just a big block of legalese in the Coding Futures EULA that lays out the terms of the license. It also explains that if we stuffed up a part of the terms of this license, the rest of them still apply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">13. &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2">License Conditions</span><span class="c1">. One of the problems with the internet is the laws where we are (the UK) may be very different to where you are. This section outlines that we&rsquo;re following UK law here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
