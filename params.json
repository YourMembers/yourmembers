{"name":"Your Members","tagline":"WordPress Member Management Plugin","body":"### Your Members\r\nThis project contains the latest trunk files of the Your Members WordPress Membership plugin, it is primarily designed as an archive for existing customers. We do not recommend people use this plugin and it is for archive purposes only.\r\n\r\nFor more information see [http://blog.yourmembers.co.uk/2013/end-of-your-members/](http://blog.yourmembers.co.uk/2013/end-of-your-members/)\r\n\r\n###WARNING\r\nThis software is supplied as is, with no warranty please read the readme before installing. We cannot offer support on this software and will not be making further additions or bug fixes.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\nYou can find the latest version of the documentation at [https://github.com/YourMembers/yourmembers/wiki/Your-Members-Documentation](https://github.com/YourMembers/yourmembers/wiki/Your-Members-Documentation)\r\n\r\n###FAQ\r\n**Why did you stop developing?**\r\nWe could no longer afford to actively develop a new version and provide support for existing version to a level we felt comfortable with. In the end we were failing to do both to a standard that our customers expected.\r\n\r\n**Is it usable?**\r\nYes. At the time of writing it was stable, we would however recommend looking at alternatives\r\n\r\n**Can I develop it?**\r\nSure but we wouldn't recommend it, the plugin has grown \"organically\" and is pretty much a guide to how not to design a modern WordPress plugin. \r\n\r\n**Will you develop feature x for me?**\r\nSorry :( but we have to draw a line and it was an all or nothing approach so I'm afraid we are unable to offer support and customisation.\r\n\r\n**Can you recommend a WordPress Membership Management Plugin?**\r\nNot really, but the closest in terms of features is S2Pro","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
