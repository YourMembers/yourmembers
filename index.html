<a name="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Why did you stop developing?</strong>
We could no longer afford to actively develop a new version and provide support for existing version to a level we felt comfortable with. In the end we were failing to do both to a standard that our customers expected.</p>

<p><strong>Is it usable?</strong>
Yes. At the time of writing it was stable, we would however recommend looking at alternatives</p>

<p><strong>Can I develop it?</strong>
Sure but we wouldn't recommend it, the plugin has grown "organically" and is pretty much a guide to how not to design a modern WordPress plugin. </p>

<p><strong>Will you develop feature x for me?</strong>
Sorry :( but we have to draw a line and it was an all or nothing approach so I'm afraid we are unable to offer support and customisation.</p>

<p><strong>Can you recommend a WordPress Membership Management Plugin?</strong>
Not really, but the closest in terms of features is S2Pro</p>
